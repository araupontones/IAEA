# Executive Summary

# Introduction




This report presents the findings of the Social and Economic Impact Assessment of Non Destructive Testing (NDT) of the RCA in Asia and the Pacific. The data to inform the analysis was collected through an online survey conducted between June and August 2021. The main respondents of the survey were national experts on the field of NDT whom provided relevant information about the equipment, training centres, certified personal, and health and safety impacts of the RCA programme in their country. 


From the 22 countries that are part of the Cooperative Agreement for Research (RCA), 20 participated in the survey: Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The aim of this section is to assess the extent to which **i) the Government Parties (GPs) have fulfilled the Multilateral Recognition Agreement (MRA) requirements** of the International Commitee on Non-destructive Testing (ICNDT) as a result of the support under the RCA programme of IAEA; **ii) The support in establishing GPsâ NDT infrastructure through the RCA  has enabled GPs to produce certified personnel** in advanced techniques (RT-D, PAUT,  TOFD, PEC, etc), in addition to the conventional methods (RT, UT, MT, PT, ET), and **iii) the GPs have  achieved increased self-reliance in NDT**, including offering training and inspection activities to local industries as well as abroad. 

This section presents the main findings in terms of Infrastructure, Inspection companies and training centres, and certified personnel.


## Infrastructure 

For this evaluation, an excellent performance in terms of infrastructure is defined as the extent to which a GPs has fullfiled the MRA requirements of ICNDT and the status of the NDT infrastructure at the national level.  

Figure \@ref(fig:cert-standards) shows the level of NDT infrastructure that each GP has in its country and the evaluation standards for each: out of the 20 countries that participated in the online survey, only Nepal and Myanmar do not have established a National Certification Scheme yet; Almost all countries but Laos, Cambodia, Nepal, and Myanmar have registered their NDT society in the Asia Pacific Federation of NDT (APFNDT); and for 10 out of the 20 GPs, their NCB for NDT has been accredited to ISO 17024.

Based on the criterion developed by RCA to assess the performance of GPs in terms of infrastructure, Australia, China, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea have excellent standards on this dimension. (See criterion and standards in Annex X)

### Contribution of RCA in GP's infrastructure

To asses the contribution of RCA in the stablishement of NCBs and Naitonal Certification Schemes, the participants of the online survey were asked the extent to which they believe that the RCA NDT programme has contributed to the establishment of this infrastructure in their countries.

As it can be seen in the Table \@ref(tab:cert-contribution), ten GPs **(Bangladesh, China, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Sri Lanka) perceived that the RCA programme has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of their national NCB**. Only Australia, Japan, and New Zealand perceived that the establishment of their RCA could have been achieved without the support from the RCA programme.

## Inspection companies and training centers

Self reliance in NDT is a function of countries having the capacity to conduct inspection and train personnel without depending on external stakeholders. An assessment to map whether GPs have inspection and training centers owned locally or by foreigners was conducted to estimate the level of self-reliance that each GP has. According to the criterion developed, a GP is considered to have an excellent standard (or to have achieved increased self-reliance) if their local inspection and training centres offer their services abroad. On the other hand, the self-reliance of a GP is considered inadequate if it does not have both training and certification centres owned either by local or foreign firms.



As it can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:centre-standards) that displays the criterion and standards for this dimension. 6 countries (Australia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, and Vietnam) offer both training and inspection abroad. Moreover, Myanmar and Nepal do have access to inspection centres (either owned locally or by foreigners) but they do not have training centres offering services in their countries.

### Contribution of RCA in the development of local inspection and training centers


According to the own perception of the GPs that participated in the online survey, **the RCA NDT programme has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of inspection centres in nine of the 22 countries that are part of the programme** (Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Vietnam); in  ten countries RCA has facilitated the investment in local investment centres; And, twelve countries perceived that RCA has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of local training centres (See Table  \@ref(tab:centres-contribution))

Added specification. My main question here is that we are asking about each of these dimensions PER INDUSTRY, which makes this quite long, specially now that we added the follow-up question on the proportion of costs reduced because of NDT introduction.Given that ultimately these 4 categories are actually dimensions of productivity themselves, can we at least eliminate the following two questions about productivity in general? |At the risk of making it more complicated, we might also need to get some sense of magnitude of the productivity improvements.

I'm not sure if it's the same or different. The difference might be training of public sector scientists who oversee the NDT in criterion 1 vs takeup by industry in criterion 2? This is only a wild guess. OK. I guess we will get to know when they test the questionnaire.                                       |
