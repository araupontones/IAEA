**Strengthened radiotherapy workforce **

1. Achieve self-reliance in RT, including offering educational training programmes, and establishing Radio Oncology (RO) Departments and Societies.

2. Establish GP's infrastructure to produce RT specialists in Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, Radiation Technology Therapists, and Radiation Oncology Nurses.

## Criterion 1.1 Achieve self-reliance in RT




To have an approximation of the self-reliance in RT of each GP to strength its radiotherapy workforce, the number of  educational/training programmes on RT, Radiation Oncology (RO) Departments, and RO Societies that are available in country was estimated.  


As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:train-plot), **there are a total of `r text_train$tot_train` educational/training programmes (ET) on RT available across all the Radiotherapy RCA's GPs**. Vietnam and China are the countries where more training programmes on RT are available (20), followed by South Korea and Japan where 15 and 10 ETs are available.

According to the responses of the GPS, there are none training programmes on RT available in `r text_train$train0`.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/number_trained.png"))
```

Moreover, **there a total of `r text_train$tot_dep` Radiation Oncology (RO) Departments across all the GPs**. From all those departments `r text_train$dep_china_per` are located in China, `r text_train$dep_japan_per` in Japan, and 15.6% in India. Figure \@ref(fig:dep-plot) shows the number of RO Deparments available in each GP.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/number_dep.png"))
```

**Accros all the GPs there are a total of `r txt_soc$tot_soc` Societies from which `r txt_soc$reg_perc` are regional societies**. The countries with the largest number of societies are China (39), India (14) and Japan (5). `r txt_soc$c_national` have societies at the national level but not at the regional one.


Figure \@ref(fig:soc-plot) shows the number of national and regional RO societies estanlished accross the GPs.

### Contribution of the RT RCA in Achieve self-reliance in RT


To assess the contribution of RCA in the establishment of training programmes, RO departments, and RO societies, the participants of the online survey were asked the extent to which they perceive that the RCA has contributed to the establishment of this infrastructure in their countries. The main findings in this respect are the following:


* **From the 17 GPs for which a training programme is available in their countries, 8 (47%) reported that RCA contributed to a great extent in their establishment, and 6 that RCA's support contributed to some extent**. 2 countries reported that the training programmes could had been available even without the support from RCA, one of this countries is New Zealand which is a non-recipient country.


* 73% of the GPs where an RO Department has been established reported that RCA somehow contributed to its establishment. **Cambodia, China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam reported that RCA contributed to a great extent in the establishment of their RO departments.** Only Mongolia, New Zealand, and Singapore perceived that RCA has not contributed to the establishment of their RO departments.


* China, Japan, Mongolia,Philippines, and Sri Lanka, Vietnam reported that RCA contribution was key to the establishment of their RO societies. 

* Although Laos and Palau have not established any of this infrastructure, this is expected because they joined RCA in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

The detailed contribution of RCA to the GP's self-reliance can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:c1-cont). *The empty squares in the chart indicate that those GPs did not provide information to the online survey for either the number of available infrastructure or on their perception of RCA's contribution in this topic.*

### Performance standards of Educational programmes

* **Adequate**: RCA contributed to the GPs has at least one of the EP, RO dep, NS

* **Good**: the GPs has two of the EP, RO dep, NS

* **Excellent** : the GPs all of the EP, RO dep, NS






## 1.2 Establish GP's infrastructure to produce RT specialists

**In 2020 there were, approximately, a total of `r txt_spec$total_20` RT specialists across all the GPs that are part of RT RCA, from which `r txt_spec$perc_cert_20` were certified specialists**. The country with more RT specialists is `r txt_spec$count1` with  `r txt_spec$count1_num` specialists followed by `r txt_spec$count2` and `r txt_spec$count3` who have trained `r txt_spec$count2_num` and `r txt_spec$count3_num` specialists respectively. 

**The method for which more specialists have been trained is `r txt_spec$meth1` with anout `r txt_spec$meth1_num` specialists trained on RT**. Figure \@ref(fig:spec-china) shows the total number of RT specialist by GP and the proportion of specialists that are certified in 2020. 

*Australia, India, Laos, Myanmar, and New Zealand did not report, during the online survey, whether their RT specialist are certified or not. Thus, their figures are coded as "Unknown" in the Figure below*.


```{r spec-china, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of RT specialists by GP."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/number_specialists_china.png"))
```

As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:g-spec), that shows the distribution of specialists by method and by country, **across all the GPs, there are `r txt_g$g_spec` more RT specialists in 2020 than they were in 2000. This figure represents a growth of `r txt_g$g_grow` for this period**. In absolute terms, the country with a higher growth of total RT specialists is `r txt_g$count1` (`r txt_g$count1_num` new specialists) . However, in terms of proportional growth, `r txt_g$grow1`  is the GP with a fastest growing number of RT specialist (`r txt_g$g_perc1` more in 2020 compared to 2000). 

India, Laos, and New Zealand reported that they did not have RT specialist in 2000 but that they have managed to produce specialists ever since.   

Figure \@ref(fig:g-spec) below shows the growth in number of RT specialist in each GP since 2000. 

```{r g-spec, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of RT specialists by GP."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/growth_specialists.png"))
```


Figure \@ref(fig:g-spec) shows the distribution of certified specialists by method and by GP in 2020 (*to make the distribution of specialists easier to read, the Figure excludes China because it has a much larger number of specialists than the rest of the GPs)*. As can be seen in the figure, **after China, the country with the highest number of Radiation Therapists (RT) specialists is Japan (about 2,000 specialists in this field)**, followed by South Korea (750). Japan is also the GP with the highest number of certified Oncologists (899). 

*The countries for which the box is coded in gray is because they did not report whether their specialists are certified or not.
