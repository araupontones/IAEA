To understand the contribution of the RT RCA programme to developing the capacity and capability of the Government Parties (GPs) to strength their radiotherapy workforce, this section presents the results of the assessment of the extent to which the support of the RT RCA has enabled GPs to:


1. Offer educational training programmes, and establish Radio Oncology (RO) Departments and Societies.

2. Produce RT specialists in Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, Radiation Technology Therapists, and Radiation Oncology Nurses.

Key indicators and results of this assessment are summarized in the below table

```{r table-c1, child=c('1.1.key_indicators_c1.rmd')}
```



## Criterion 1.1 Offer educational training programmes, and establish Radio Oncology (RO) Departments and Societies


To have an approximation of the capacity of each GP to strength its radiotherapy workforce, the number of  educational/training programmes on RT, Radiation Oncology (RO) Departments, and RO Societies that are available in each country was estimated.  


#### Educational training programmes

As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:train-plot), **there are a total of `r text_train$tot_train` educational/training programmes (ET) on RT available across all the RT RCA's GPs**. Vietnam and China are the countries where more training programmes on RT are available (20), followed by South Korea and Japan where 15 and 10 ETs are available.

According to the responses of the GPs, there are none training programmes on RT available in `r text_train$train0`.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/number_trained.png"))
```


#### Radiation Oncology Departments

**There a total of `r text_train$tot_dep` Radiation Oncology (RO) Departments across all the GPs**. From all those departments `r text_train$dep_china_per` are located in China, `r text_train$dep_japan_per` in Japan, and 15.6% in India. Figure \@ref(fig:dep-plot) shows the number of RO Departments available in each GP. 



```{r dep-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of educational or training programmes on RT available by GP."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/number_dep.png"))
```

#### Radiation Oncology Societies

**Accros all the GPs there are a total of `r txt_soc$tot_soc` Societies from which `r txt_soc$reg_perc` are regional societies**. The countries with the largest number of societies are China (39), India (14) and Japan (5). `r txt_soc$c_national` have societies at the national level but not at the regional one.


Figure \@ref(fig:soc-plot) shows the number of national and regional RO societies established across the GPs.

```




## Criterion 1.2 Produce RT specialists

* Across all the GPs that are part of RT RCA, **in 2020 there were, approximately, a total of `r txt_spec$total_20` RT specialists , from which `r txt_spec$perc_cert_20` were certified specialists**. The country with more RT specialists is `r txt_spec$count1` with  `r txt_spec$count1_num` specialists followed by `r txt_spec$count2` and `r txt_spec$count3` that have produced `r txt_spec$count2_num` and `r txt_spec$count3_num` specialists respectively. 

* **The method for which more specialists have been trained is `r txt_spec$meth1` with about `r txt_spec$meth1_num` specialists trained on RT**. 

Figure \@ref(fig:spec-china) shows the total number of RT specialist by GP and the proportion of specialists that are certified in 2020 by RT method. 

*Australia, India, Laos, Myanmar, and New Zealand did not report, during the online survey, whether their RT specialist are certified or not. Thus, their bars are coded as "Unknown" in the Figure below*.


```{r spec-china, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of RT specialists by GP in 2000 and 2020."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/number_specialists_china.png"))
```

#### RT specialists in 2000 and 2020


```{r g-spec, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of RT specialists by GP."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/growth_specialists.png"))
```


As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:g-spec) above, that shows the distribution of RT specialists by country, **across all the GPs, there are `r txt_g$g_spec` more RT specialists in 2020 than they were in 2000. This increase represents a growth of `r txt_g$g_grow` for this period**. In absolute terms, the country with a higher growth of RT specialists since 2000 is `r txt_g$count1` (`r txt_g$count1_num` new specialists) . However, in proportional terms, `r txt_g$grow1`  is the GP with the fastest growing number of RT specialist (`r txt_g$g_perc1` more in 2020 compared to 2000). Figure \@ref(fig:gp-spec) shows the percentage change of RT specialists between 2000 and 2020.

*Myanmar is the only GP that reported a negative percentage change of RT specialists. Although they reported to have Medical Physicists, Radiation Oncologists, Radiation Therapists, and RO Nurses in 2000, they did not report the number of Medical Physicists, Radiation Therapists, and RO Nurses.*

```{r gp-spec, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Percentage change of RT specialists between 2000 and 2020 by GP."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/growth_specialists_perc.png"))
```



India, Laos, and New Zealand reported that they did not have RT specialist in 2000 but that they have managed to produce specialists ever since.   



#### RT specialists by method

Figure \@ref(fig:m-spec) below shows the distribution of **certified specialists** by method and by GP in 2020 (*to make the distribution of specialists easier to read, the Figure excludes China because it has a much larger number of specialists than the rest of the GPs, and the countries for which the box is coded in gray is because they did not report whether their specialists are certified or not)*.

```{r m-spec, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of RT specialists by GP."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "1.criterion/method_specialists.png"))
```

As can be seen in the Figure above, **after China, the country with the highest number of Radiation Therapists (RT) specialists is Japan (about 2,000 specialists in this field)**, followed by South Korea (750). Japan is also the GP with the highest number of certified Oncologists (899). 





## Contribution of RT RCA in strengthening ratiotherapy workforce

This section presents the results of the extent to which, the GPs perceived that, RCA has contributed in the establishment of training programmes, RO departments, RO societies, and the production of RT specialists in their countries. 


* As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:c1-cont) below, **out of the 17 GPs for which a training programme is available in their countries, 14 (82.3%) reported that RCA contributed to some extent in their establishment**. 2 GPs reported that the training programmes could had been available even without the support from RCA, one of these countries is New Zealand which is a non-recipient country and the other is Pakistan.


* **73% of the GPs where an RO Department has been established reported that RCA contributed to its establishment**. Cambodia, China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam reported that RCA contributed to a great extent in the establishment of their RO departments. Only Mongolia, New Zealand, and Singapore perceived that RCA has not contributed to the establishment of their RO departments.


* **China, Japan, Mongolia,Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam reported that RCA contribution was key to the establishment of their RO societies**. 


* 9 out of the 19 historically recipient countries (Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, and Philippines) reported that RCA contributed to a great extent in the production of RT specialists. And 6 of these 19 countries perceived that RCA contributed somehow to produce their specialists. Thus **17 out of the 19 historically recipient countries consider that RCA contributed to the increase of certified RT specialists between 2000 and 2020**. 

* From the countries that provided information about RCA's contribution, only Palau, and New Zealand reported that RCA has not contributed to the strengthening of their RT workforce. New Zealand have acted historically as non-recipients, and Palau joined RT RCA in 2019.

Figure \@ref(fig:c1-cont) shows the detailed contribution of RCA to the GP's self-reliance. 

*The numbers within the boxes represent the total number of training programmes, RO departments, RO societies, and RT specialists that each GP reported for the 2020 period. The white boxes indicate that those GPs did not provide information about their perception of RCA's contribution in that dimension*.
