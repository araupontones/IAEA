**Strengthened radiotherapy workforce **

1. Achieve self-reliance in RT, including offering educational training programmes, and establishing Radio Oncology (RO) Departments and Societies.

2. Establish GP's infrastructure to produce RT specialists in Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, Radiation Technology Therapists, and Radiation Oncology Nurses.




## Criterion 1.1 Achieve self-reliance in RT


### Contribution of the RT RCA in Achieve self-reliance in RT

To have an approximation of the self-reliance in RT of each GP to strength its radiotherapy workforce, the number of  educational/training programmes on RT, Radiation Oncology (RO) Departments, and RO Societies that are available in country was estimated.  


As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:train-plot), **there are a total of `r text_train$tot_train` educational programmes on RT available across all the GPs that are part of the RCA programme**. Vietnam and China are the countries where more programmes (20) are on RT are available, followed by South Korea and Japan where 15 and 10 educational programmes are available.

According to the responses of the GPS, there are none training programmes available in `r text_train$train0`.

```

Moreover, **there a total of `r text_train$tot_dep` Radiation Oncology (RO) Departments across all the GPs**. From all those departments `r text_train$dep_china_per` are located in China, `r text_train$dep_japan_per` in Japan, and `r text_train$dep_india_per` in India. Figure \@ref(fig:dep-plot) shows the number of RO Deparments available in each GP.

Figure \@ref(fig:soc-plot) shows the number of national and regional RO societies estanlished accross the GPs.

### Performance standards of Educational programmes

* **Adequate**: RCA contributed to the GPs has at least one of the EP, RO dep, NS

* **Good**: the GPs has two of the EP, RO dep, NS

* **Excellent** : the GPs all of the EP, RO dep, NS
