This section presents the findings on the contribution of the RT RCA programme to the Increased access to quality radiotherapy in the GPs that are part of the programme and that participated in the online survey. In particular, the objective of the analysis is to understand the extent to which the support of the RT programme has contributed to:

1. Increase operational RT equipment and technology

2. Increase the number and quality of treatment of cancer patients using domestic RT facilities

```



## Criterion 2.1 Increase operational RT equipment and technology


```{r mach-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Total number of operational RT equipment by GP (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) by GP between 2000 and 2020."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/number_machines.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:mach-plot) above shows the total number of operational RT equipment (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) available by GP in 2000, 2010, and 2020. 

**In 2000, there were approximately `r txt_mach$tot_0` operational RT equipment (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) across all the GPs that are part of the RT RCA programme**. By 2020, this figure has increased to `r txt_mach$tot_20` **which represents a percentage growth of `r txt_mach$g_grow` between 2000 and 2020**. `r txt_mach$count1` is the country where more operational RT equipment is available (`r txt_mach$count1_num` machines), followed by `r txt_mach$count2` that has `r txt_mach$count2_num` RT machines, and `r txt_mach$count3` (`r txt_mach$count3_num` linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines). Palau is the only country that reported not to have any operational RT equipment available in their country.

The largest total increase in treatment machines in the period 2000 to 2010 was reported by `r txt_mach$grow1` that reported a total increase of `r txt_mach$grow1_num` in this period. However, in terms of relative terms, the largest increase was observed for `r txt_mach$perc1` which reported to have `r txt_mach$perc1_num` more RT equipment in 2020 in relation to 2020. 





## Criterion 2.2 Increase the number and quality of treatment of cancer patients using domestic RT facilities

This section presents the findings on the analysis made about the total number of cancer patients treated and the approximate average waiting times for the patients to be treated. 

#### Cancer patients treated using domestic RT
Approximately, across all the GPs that are part of RT RCA,  **there were `r txt_pat$g_pat` more total number of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities in 2020 than they were in 2020  (an increment of `r txt_pat$g_grow`)**. In 2000 there were `r txt_pat$tot_0` patients reported and `r txt_pat$tot_20` in 2020. 

In 2020, across all the GPs, `r txt_pat$count1` was the country where more cancer patients were treated using domestic RT facilities (`r txt_pat$count1_num` patients), followed by `r txt_pat$count2` (`r txt_pat$count2_num` patients), and `r txt_pat$count3` (`r txt_pat$count3_num`). 

Figure \@ref(fig:pat-plot) shows the total number of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities by GPs between 2000 and 2020. 

```{r pat-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Total number of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities by GPs between 2000 and 2020."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/number_patients.png"))
```

#### Waiting times 


```{r wait-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Proportion of patients that experienced less that 10 days of waiting time by GP and by year."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/waiting_improve.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:wait-plot) shows the proportion of patients that experienced less than 10 days of waiting time in 2000 and in 2020 for each of the GPs that provided this information.

**The proportion of patients that experienced less than 10 days of waiting time increased from `r txt_wait$w_0` in 2000 to `r txt_wait$w_20` in 2020**. In countries like Cambodia, Philippines, South Korea, and Vietnam more than 80% of the patients are treated in less than 10 days. The proportion of patients that are treated below this threshold increased for all countries except for Mongolia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The proportion is the same between 2000 and 2020 for New Zealand, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. 



*Australia, India, Laos, Myanmar, and Palau are not shown in the Figure because information about waiting times was not provided by these countries during the online survey.*



## Contribution of RCA on increasing access to quality radiotherapy

This section presents the findings on the extent to which RT RCA has contributed to increased access to quality radiotherapy:

* As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:techC-plot), **11 GPs reported that RT RCA has contributed to introduce the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) technology in their countries** (`r txt_ctech$imrt`), also 11 that being part of the programme contributed to the introduction of 3-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) (`r txt_ctech$crt`). Only China, and Philippines reported that RT RCA contributed to introduce Particle Therapy to their countries.

*In the chart below, the acronyms stand for: Stereotactic Body radiation Therapy (SRT), and 3-dimensional Image-Guided Brachytherapy (3D-IGBT)* 

```{r techC-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Contribution of RCA to introduce RT technologies."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/contribution_tech.png"))
```

* **6 out the 19 recipient GPs `r txt_ctech$mach_c` reported that CA RT cause their country to invest in additional RT equipment** (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) between 2000 and 2020.

* **84.2% of the GPs consider that the quality of RT services offered in their improved as a result of participating in the RCA RT programme**.


* **75% of the GPs reorted that RCA contributed somehow to the decrease in the average waiting time for treatment**. Philippines, and Vietnam perceived that RCA contributed to a great extent to reduce the average waiting time of treatment. Figure \@ref(fig:waitC-plot) shows the perception of each GP on the contribution of RCA to the decrease of waiting times. *Australia, India, Laos, Myanmar, and Palau did not reported this information during the online survey**
