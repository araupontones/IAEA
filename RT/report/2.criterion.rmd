This section presents the findings on the contribution of the RT RCA programme to the increased access to quality radiotherapy in the GPs that are part of the programme and that participated in the online survey. In particular, the objective of the analysis is to understand the extent to which the support of the RT programme has contributed to:

1. Increase operational RT equipment and technology.

2. Increase the number and quality of treatment of cancer patients using domestic RT facilities.

## Criterion 2.1 Increase operational RT equipment and technology


```{r mach-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Total number of operational RT equipment by GP (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) by GP between 2000 and 2020."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/number_machines.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:mach-plot) above shows the total number of operational RT equipment (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) available by GP in 2000, 2010, and 2020. As can be seen in the figure `r txt_mach$count1` is the country where more operational RT equipment is available (`r txt_mach$count1_num` machines) in 2020, followed by `r txt_mach$count2` that has `r txt_mach$count2_num` RT machines, and `r txt_mach$count3` (`r txt_mach$count3_num`). Palau is the only country that reported not to have any operational RT equipment available in their country.

The largest total increase in treatment machines in the period 2000 to 2020 was reported by `r txt_mach$grow1` that reported a total increase of `r txt_mach$grow1_num`. However, in relative terms, the largest increase was observed for `r txt_mach$perc1` which reported to have `r txt_mach$perc1_num` more RT equipment in 2020 in relation to 2000.

**Overall, in 2000, there were approximately `r txt_mach$tot_0` operational RT equipment (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) across all the GPs that are part of the RT RCA programme**. By 2020, this figure has increased to `r txt_mach$tot_20` **which represents a percentage growth of `r txt_mach$g_grow` between 2000 and 2020**.  

Figure \@ref(fig:mach-g) shows the percentage change of operational RT equipment between 2010 and 2020 by GP.

## Criterion 2.2 Increase the number and quality of treatment of cancer patients using domestic RT facilities

This section presents the findings on the analysis conducted on the total number of cancer patients treated and the approximate average waiting times for the patients to be treated in 2000 and 2020. 

#### Cancer patients treated using domestic RT
Approximately, **across all the GPs that are part of RT RCA,there were `r txt_pat$g_pat` more total number of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities in 2020 than they were in 2000  (an increment of `r txt_pat$g_grow`)**. In 2000 there were `r txt_pat$tot_0` patients reported and `r txt_pat$tot_20` in 2020. 

In 2020, among all the GPs, `r txt_pat$count1` was the country where more cancer patients were treated using domestic RT facilities (`r txt_pat$count1_num` patients), followed by `r txt_pat$count2` (`r txt_pat$count2_num` patients), and `r txt_pat$count3` (`r txt_pat$count3_num`). 

Figure \@ref(fig:pat-plot) shows the total number of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities by GPs between 2000 and 2020. 

```{r pat-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Total number of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities by GPs between 2000 and 2020."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/number_patients.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:pat-g) shows the percentage change of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities by GPs between 2000 and 2020.

```{r pat-g, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Percentage change of cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities by GPs between 2000 and 2020."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/growth_patients.png"))
```

#### Waiting times 


```{r wait-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Proportion of patients that experienced less that 10 days of waiting time by GP and by year."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/waiting_improve.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:wait-plot) shows the proportion of patients that experienced less than 10 days of waiting time in 2000 and in 2020 for each of the GPs that provided this information. As can be seen in the Figure, **the proportion of patients that are treated in less than 10 days increased, during this period, for all countries except for Mongolia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan**. The proportion of patients that are treated in less that 10 days in 2000 and 2020 is the same for New Zealand, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. 

In countries like Cambodia, Philippines, South Korea, and Vietnam more than 80% of the patients are treated in less than 10 days. 

**Overall, the proportion of patients that experienced less than 10 days of waiting time increased from `r txt_wait$w_0` in 2000 to `r txt_wait$w_20` in 2020 across all the GPs that are part of the RT RCA programme**. 


As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:waitfreq-plot) that shows the proportion of patients treated by waiting time and by GP in 2020. The 100% of the patients of South Korea experienced less than 5 days of waiting times. In Vietnam, the proportion of patients that are treated in less than 5 days is 60%. 

```{r waitfreq-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Proportion of patients treated by waiting time and GP."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/waiting_freq.png"))
```

The complete distribution of waiting times in the period 2000 to 2020 is presented in the Annex. 

*Australia, India, Laos, Myanmar, and Palau are not shown in the Figures because information about waiting times was not provided by these countries during the online survey.*


#### Population coverage


Figure \@ref(fig:pop-plot) shows the approximate proportion (%) of the population in each country that lives within a radius of 100km from a RT equipment. By RT equipment it is meant linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines. As can be seen in the chart, Singapore and South Korea reported that 100% of their population live within a radius of 100km from a RT equipment.

## Contribution of RCA on increasing access to quality radiotherapy

This section presents the findings on the extent to which RT RCA has contributed to increased access to quality radiotherapy:


* As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:techC-plot), **11 GPs reported that RT RCA has contributed to introduce the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) technology in their countries** (`r txt_ctech$imrt`).


* **55% of the GPs reported that being part of the programme contributed to the introduction of 3-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT)** (`r txt_ctech$crt`). 

*In the chart below, the acronyms stand for: Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT), 3-Dimensional Image-Guided Brachytherapy (3D-IGBT), and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SRT).* 

```{r techC-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Contribution of RCA to introduce RT technologies."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots, "2.criterion/contribution_tech.png"))
```

* **6 out the 19 recipient GPs `r txt_ctech$mach_c` reported that between 2000 and 2020 being part of the RT RCA caused their country to invest in additional RT equipment** (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines).

* **84.2% of the GPs consider that the quality of RT services offered in their improved as a result of participating in the RCA RT programme**.


*  As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:waitC-plot) that shows the perception of each GP on the contribution of RCA to the decrease of waiting times, **75% of the GPs reported that RCA contributed somehow to the decrease in the average waiting time for treatment**. Philippines, and Vietnam perceived that RCA contributed to a great extent to reduce the average waiting time of treatment. 

*Australia, India, Laos, Myanmar, and Palau did not reported information about waiting times during the online survey*.
