* Out of the 22 countries that are part of the Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) for Research (Development and Training in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) in Asia and the Pacific), `r text_intro$number` participated in the online survey: `r text_intro$names` **The support and cooperation of country representatives and IAEA staff during these unusual circumstances is gratefully acknowledged**.

* Out the 22 countries that are part of RCA, 18 currently act as recipients of the IAEA Technical Co-operation Programme (TCP). The other four (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and very recently Korea) have voluntarily decided not to receive the IAEA TCP, but they work as resource countries to provide support for the IAEA TCP. **Based on this definition, the three countries that have historically acted as non-recipients (Australia, Japan and New Zealand) are excluded from the assessment of the criteria and level of performance conducted in this analysis. Given their historically non-recipient character, any assessment of the performance of RCA to accelerate and enlarge the application of NDT technologies in those countries would result in a misinterpretation of the results**.


* In 2020, across all the GPs that are part of the Radiotherapy (RT) RCA programme, there were a total of `r text_train$tot_train` educational programmes on RT available, `r text_train$tot_dep` Radio Oncology (RO) Departments, and  `r txt_soc$tot_soc` RO Societies. From the 17 GPs for which an educational programme is available, 15 (88%) reported that RCA's support contributed to a great or some extent in their establishment.

* Compared to 2000, in 2020 there were `r txt_g$g_spec` more RT specialists in all the countries that are part of RT RCA. This figure represents a growth of `r txt_g$g_grow` in the period this period. And, 17 out of the 19 historically recipient countries consider that RCA contributed to certain extent to the increase of certified RT specialists between 2000 and 2020.


* Across all the GPs that are part of the RT RCA programme, in 2000, there were approximately `r txt_mach$tot_0` operational RT equipment (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines). By 2020, this figure increased to `r txt_mach$tot_20` which represents a percentage growth of `r txt_mach$g_grow` between 2000 and 2020.


* Approximately, across all the GPs that are part of RT RCA, there were `r txt_pat$g_pat` more cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities in 2020 than they were in 2020  (an increment of `r txt_pat$g_grow`). In 2000 there were `r txt_pat$tot_0` patients reported and `r txt_pat$tot_20` in 2020. 

* The approximate average 5-year local control rate across all GPs in 2000 and 2020 was `r txt_control$c_0` and `r txt_control$c_20` respectively. Which implies an increase of `r txt_control$imp_c` (percentage points) in this period. 93% of the GPs that reported an increase of the 5-year control rate between 2000 and 2020, considered that RT RCA had some positive impact to achieve this result.

* From 2000 to 2020 the approximate average 5-year survival rate across all types of cancer increased `r txt_control$imp_l` (percentage points) across all GPs. The average survival rate was `r txt_control$l_0` in 2000 and `r txt_control$c_20` in 2020. 86.6% of the GPs that reported a positive increase in the 5-year survival rate between this period, considered that the RT RCA support contributed to it.
