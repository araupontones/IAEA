* Out of the 22 countries that are part of the Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) for Research (Development and Training in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) in Asia and the Pacific), `r text_intro$number` participated in the online survey: `r text_intro$names` **The support and cooperation of country representatives and IAEA staff during these unusual circumstances is gratefully acknowledged**.

* Out the 22 countries that are part of RCA, 18 currently act as recipients of the IAEA Technical Co-operation Programme (TCP). The other four (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and very recently Korea) have voluntarily decided not to receive the IAEA TCP, but they work as resource countries to provide support for the IAEA TCP. **Based on this definition, the three countries that have historically acted as non-recipients (Australia, Japan and New Zealand) are excluded from the assessment of the criteria and level of performance conducted in this analysis. Given their historically non-recipient character, any assessment of the performance of RCA to accelerate and enlarge the application of NDT technologies in those countries would result in a misinterpretation of the results**.


* Across all the GPs that are part of the RCA programme, there are a total of `r text_train$tot_train` educational programmes on RT available, `r text_train$tot_dep` Radio Oncology (RO) Departments, and  `r txt_soc$tot_soc` RO Societies. From the 17 GPs for which an educational programme is available, 15 (88%) reported that RCA's support contributed to a great or some extent in their establishment.

* Compared to 2000, in 2020 there are `r txt_g$g_spec` more RT specialists in all the countries that are part of RT RCA. This figure represents a growth of `r txt_g$g_grow` in the period 2000 to 2020. And, 17 out of the 19 historically recipient countries (89%) consider that RCA contributed to certain extent to the increase of certified RT specialists between 2000 and 2020.


* In 2000, there were approximately `r txt_mach$tot_0` operational RT equipment (linear accelerators and Cobalt 60 machines) across all the GPs that are part of the RT RCA programme. By 2020, this figure has increased to `r txt_mach$tot_20` which represents a percentage growth of `r txt_mach$g_grow` between 2000 and 2020.


* Approximately, across all the GPs that are part of RT RCA, there were `r txt_pat$g_pat` more cancer patients treated using domestic RT facilities in 2020 than they were in 2020  (an increment of `r txt_pat$g_grow`). In 2000 there were `r txt_pat$tot_0` patients reported and `r txt_pat$tot_20` in 2020.
