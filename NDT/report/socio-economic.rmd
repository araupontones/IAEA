The assessment of the social and economic impacts of the NDT RCA programme involved pre-defining agreed performance criteria (aspects of social and economic impacts that were the focus of the evaluation) and standards (narratives describing four levels of performance – excellent, good, adequate, and inadequate). These criteria and standards (detailed in Annex G) provided a transparent and robust framework for rating the impact of the NDT RCA. 


To understand the contribution of the NDT RCA programme on social and economic indicators, the study analyses the extent to which being part of the programme has enabled the GPs to: 

**Improve NDT capacity and capability**

1.	Fulfill the Multilateral Recognition Agreement (MRA) requirements of the International Committee on Non-destructive Testing (ICNDT) as a result of the support under the NDT RCA programme;

2.	Establish GPs’ NDT infrastructure to produce certified personnel in advanced techniques (Radiographic Testing - Digital , Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing, Time of Flight Diffraction , and Pulsed Eddy Current), in addition to the conventional methods (Radiographic Testing, Ultrasonic Testing, Magnetic Testing, Penetrant Testing , and Eddy Current Testing); 

3.	Achieve self-reliance in NDT, including offering training and inspection activities to local industries as well as abroad;

**Increase scope and scale of NDT demand and use**

4.	Enhance awareness, interest, and application of NDT technology in the industrial sectors for the quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) of industrial components;

5.	Develop knowledge developed through R&D by publishing research articles, organising international and national seminars and conferences; and

**Improved health and safety**

6. Improve health and safety by applying NDT technology in the industrial sectors.

It is worth mentioning that the IAEA Technical Co-operation Programme (TCP) has been established by the IAEA to support IAEA Member States (MSs) (especially developing countries) to accelerate and enlarge the application of nuclear technologies in a safe, secure, effective, and efficient manner. In principle, every IAEA MS can receive and enjoy the benefit of the IAEA TCP. However, some MSs (especially developed/advanced MSs) volunteer not to receive the IAEA TCP, but they work as resource countries to provide support for the IAEA TCP. Under the RCA, there are 22 countries, of which 18 countries are TC recipients and 4 are TC non-recipients (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and very recently Korea).  **Based on this definition, the three countries that have historically acted as non-recipients (Australia, Japan and New Zealand) are excluded from the assessment of the criteria and level of performance conducted in this analysis. Given their historically non-recipient character, any assessment of the performance of RCA to accelerate and enlarge the application of NDT technologies in those countries would result in a misinterpretation of the results.**

Figure \@ref(fig:standards-sum) summarises the performance of each GP against the defined criteria (aspects of performance) and standards (levels of performance).
