* Out of the 22 countries that are part of the Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) for Research (Development and Training in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) in Asia and the Pacific), `r text_intro$number` participated in the online survey: `r text_intro$names` **The support and cooperation of country representatives and IAEA staff during these unusual circumstances is gratefully acknowledged**.

* Out the 22 countries that are part of RCA, 18 currently act as recipients of the IAEA Technical Co-operation Programme (TCP). The other four (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and very recently Korea) have voluntarily decided not to receive the IAEA TCP, but they work as resource countries to provide support for the IAEA TCP. **Based on this definition, the three countries that have historically acted as non-recipients (Australia, Japan and New Zealand) are excluded from the assessment of the criteria and level of performance conducted in this analysis. Given their historically non-recipient character, any assessment of the performance of RCA to accelerate and enlarge the application of NDT technologies in those countries would result in a misinterpretation of the results.**


* Eleven out of the eighteen recipient Government Parties (GPs) have established a National Certification Body (NCB), and 60% of them perceived that the RCA programme has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of their body.


* From 2000 to 2020, the NDT RCA programme has contributed, yearly, to the certification of roughly `r txt_cert_pers$tot_year` personnel by local NDT Accredited Training Centres in `r txt_cert_pers$certified_number_countries` countries. From the total certified personnel, `r txt_cert_pers$perc_certified_women` are female.

* The method for which RCA has contributed the most to the certification of personnel is `r txt_cert_pers$certified_top_method_name` (`r txt_cert_pers$certified_top_method_num` personnel certified per year), followed by `r txt_cert_pers$certified_second_method_name` and `r txt_cert_pers$certified_third_method_name`. 

* There are over `r txt_num_centres$local_inspec_ct` inspection centres owned by local firms across all the GPs that participate in the NDT RCA programme. According to respondents from the GPs, the RCA NDT programme has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of inspection centres in `r txt_cont_centres$alot_inspec_num` of the eighteen countries that are recipients of the programme.

* `r text_rd_c$activities` of GPs that have established any R&D activities related to NDT and `r text_rd_c$publications` publications related to NDT that have been published since 2000 are result of being part of the RCA NDT programme.

* `r text_hs$ap_perc` of GPs reported that the RCA NDT programme contributed to NDT technologies being applied for safer operations of nuclear and other industrial installations.

* For `r text_impact$speed_y_perc` of the recipient GPs, RCA NDT has helped to speed up the adoption of NDT technologies in their country.

* `r text_impact$adopt_perc` of the recipient GPs reported that NDT RCA has contributed to the adoption of NDT technologies by private business in their countries since 2000. Half of these countries estimated that 25% or more of the total activity in their NDT sector can be attributed to being involved in the NDT RCA programme.


* 82% of the receipient GPs consider that the role of IAEA/RCA activities in achieving the general objectives and benefits of NDT on socio-economic impact through industrial growth in their countries is excellent or good.
