To assess the contribution of the NDT RCA programme in the capacity and capability of the Government Parties (GPs). This section presents the results of the assessment to the extent to which the support of the NDT RCA programme has enable GPs to:

1. Fulfill the Multilateral Recognition Agreement (MRA) requirements of the International Committee on Non-destructive Testing (ICNDT) as a result of the support under the RCA programme of IAEA; 

2. Establish GPsâ€™ NDT infrastructure to produce certified personnel in advanced techniques (RT-D, PAUT,  TOFD, PEC, etc), in addition to the conventional methods (RT, UT, MT, PT, ET); and 

3. Achieve self-reliance in NDT, including offering training and inspection activities to local industries as well as abroad. 


The table below shows the evaluation criteria and the standards to assess the impact of NDT RCA on the GP's capacity and capability.

```{r, child=c('2.1.criterion1_table.rmd')}
```

### Fulfillment of the Multilateral Recognition Agreement

For this evaluation, an excellent performance for this dimension is defined as the extent to which a GPs has fullfiled the MRA requirements of ICNDT and the status of the NDT infrastructure at the national level.  



#### Contribution of RCA in GP's fulfilling the Multilateral Recognition Agreement

To asses the contribution of RCA in the establishment of NCBs and Naitonal Certification Schemes, the participants of the online survey were whether the Government Party has established a National Certification scheme and a National Certification Body (NCB) and the extent to which they perceive that the RCA NDT programme has contributed to the establishment of this infrastructure in their countries.

As it can be seen in the Table \@ref(tab:cert-contribution),  from the `r txt_cont_cert$has_NCB_num` GPs that have established a NCB, `r txt_cont_cert$num_alot` **(`r txt_cont_cert$a_lot`) perceived that the RCA programme has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of their national NCB**. Only `r txt_cont_cert$not` perceive that the establishment of their NCB could have been achieved without the support of the RCA programme.


```{r cert-contribution}


table_cont_cert <- rio::import(file.path("indicators/1.criterion/contribution_RCA_cert.rds"))
knitr::kable(table_cont_cert, caption = "Contribution of RCA programme in GP's infrastructure")

```

<br>

#### Performance standards of infrastructure 



Figure \@ref(fig:cert-standards) shows the level of NDT infrastructure that each GP has in its country, the evaluation criteria, and the performance standards for each: from the 20 countries that participated in the study, only Nepal and Myanmar do not have established a National Certification Scheme yet; Almost all countries but Laos, Cambodia, Nepal, and Myanmar have registered their NDT society in the Asia Pacific Federation of NDT (APFNDT); and for 10 out of the 20 GPs, their NCB for NDT has been accredited to ISO 17024.

Based on the criterion developed by RCA to assess the performance of GPs in terms of infrastructure, Australia, China, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea have excellent performance standards on this dimension. (See criterion and standards in Annex X)

### NDT infrastructure to produce certified personnel 

This section presents the findings on the extent in which the support in establishing GPs' NDT **infrastructure through the RCA programme has enabled GPs to produce certified personnel in conventional methods (RT, UT, MT, PT, ET) and in advanced techniques** (RT-D, PAUT, TOFD, PEC, etc).


#### Contribution of RCA in the certification of personnel 

As it can be seen in Table \@ref(tab:certified-pers-method), **since 2020, the NDT RCA programme has contributed to the certification of `r txt_cert_pers$total_certified`  personnel by local NDT Accredited Training Centres in `r txt_cert_pers$certified_number_countries`** countries (`r txt_cert_pers$certified_names_countries`). From the total certified personnel, `r txt_cert_pers$perc_certified_women` are female. 

The method for which RCA has contributed the most to the certification of personnel is `r txt_cert_pers$certified_top_method_name` (`r txt_cert_pers$certified_top_method_num` personnel trained), followed by `r txt_cert_pers$certified_second_method_name` and `r txt_cert_pers$certified_third_method_name`. 

*As it can be seen in the table below, it is possible that RCA NDT programme has indeed sensitised and provided awareness in GP's for the introduction of certifications in the main and advanced NDT techniques; For some countries "RCA had helped introduce and sensitise the NDT programme in the early years of cooperation. However, in the last 20 years, NDT centres in the country did conduct training and certification programmes under the national NDT Society and others but they have not been, necesarily, in association with RCA* (National expert, online survey 2021).


```{r certified-pers-method}


table_cert_pers <- rio::import(file.path("indicators/1.criterion/certified_personel_by_method.rds"))
knitr::kable(table_cert_pers, caption = "Number of certified personnel by contry and technique")

```

<br>


The total number of **certified personnel under the RCA programme** by country, technique, and sex is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:certified-personnel-plot) below.




```{r certified-personnel-plot, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number personnel that was certified by local NDT training centers as a result of participating in RCA NDT."}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots,"1.criterion/number_certified_personel.png"))

```


#### Performance standards of certified personnel

According to the methodology of the evaluation, an excellent performance for this dimension is given if the RCA NDT programme has enabled a GP to produce certified personnel in all conventional and advance techniques, a good and adequate performance is considered if the support has enabled to produce certified personnel in all conventional or at least one conventional technique respectively.

Figure \@ref(fig:standards-pers-certified) shows that based on this criteria, `r txt_std_psnl$ctres_excel_num` countries have met an excellent standard (`r txt_std_psnl$ctres_excel`) because RCA NDT has contributed or facilitated the introduction of all methods and techniques to their personnel, `r txt_std_psnl$ctres_gd_num` GPs met a good standard (`r txt_std_psnl$ctres_gd`) because the RCA NDT programme has facilitated the certification of their personnel in all the conventional techniques. 

`r txt_std_psnl$ctres_iq`  are consider to have an inadequate standard because, according to responses provided by their experts, RCA NDT has not necesarily contributed to the certification of their personnel in any of these techniques.

```





### Self reliance in NDT

Self reliance in NDT is a function of countries having the capacity to conduct inspection and train personnel without depending on external stakeholders. An assessment to map whether GPs have inspection and training centers owned locally or by foreigners was conducted to estimate the level of self-reliance that each GP has. According to the criterion developed, a GP is considered to have an excellent standard (or to have achieved increased self-reliance) if their local inspection and training centres offer their services abroad. On the other hand, the self-reliance of a GP is considered inadequate if it does not have both training and certification centres owned either by local or foreign firms.



Figure  \@ref(fig:centre-by-country) below shows the number of **inspection centres** owned by local and foreign firms in each RCA country. 

```{r centre-by-country, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of inspection centres by type of ownership and country"}

```


Figure  \@ref(fig:trainingcenter-by-country) below shows the number of **training centres** own by local and foreign firms in each RCA country. 

```{r trainingcenter-by-country, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Number of inspection centres by type of ownership and country"}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(dir_plots,"1.criterion/training_centres_by_country.png"))

```


#### Contribution of RCA in the development of local inspection and training centers


According to the own perception of the GPs that participated in the online survey, **the RCA NDT programme has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of inspection centres in `r txt_cont_centres$alot_inspec_num` of the twenty-two countries that are part of the programme** (`r txt_cont_centres$alot_inspec`); in  `r txt_cont_centres$yes_investment` countries RCA has facilitated the investment in local investment centres; And, `r txt_cont_centres$alot_training_num` countries perceived that RCA has contributed to a great extent in the establishment of local training centres (See Table  \@ref(tab:centres-contribution))

  

```{r centres-contribution}


table_cont_centres <- rio::import(file.path("indicators/1.criterion/contribution_RCA_centres.rds"))
knitr::kable(table_cont_centres, caption = "Contribution of RCA programme to the establishment of local inspection and training companies.")

```
<br>

#### Performance standards of self-reliance

As it can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:centre-standards) that displays the criterion and standards for this dimension. `r text_centres$excellent_num` countries (`r text_centres$excellent_text`) offer both training and inspection abroad. Moreover, `r text_centres$inadequate_text` do have access to inspection centres (either owned locally or by foreigners) but they do not have training centres offering services in their countries.
