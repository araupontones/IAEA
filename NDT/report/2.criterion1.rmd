The aim of this section is to assess the extent to which **i) the Government Parties (GPs) have fulfilled the Multilateral Recognition Agreement (MRA) requirements** of the International Commitee on Non-destructive Testing (ICNDT) as a result of the support under the RCA programme of IAEA; **ii) The support in establishing GPsâ€™ NDT infrastructure through the RCA  has enabled GPs to produce certified personnel** in advanced techniques (RT-D, PAUT,  TOFD, PEC, etc), in addition to the conventional methods (RT, UT, MT, PT, ET), and **iii) the GPs have  achieved increased self-reliance in NDT**, including offering training and inspection activities to local industries as well as abroad. 

This section presents the main findings in terms of Infrastructure, Inspection companies and training centres, and certified personnel.


## Infrastructure 

The assessment of the status of infrastructure is defined as the extent to which the GPs have fullfiled the MRA requirements of ICNDT and the status of the NDT infrastructure at the national level.  

Figure \@ref(fig:cert-standards) shows the level of NDT infrastructure that each GP has in its country and the evaluation standards for each: out of the 20 countries that participated in the online survey, only Nepal and Myanmar do not have established a National Certification Scheme yet; Almost all countries but Laos, Cambodia, Nepal, and Myanmar have registered their NDT society in the Asia Pacific Federation of NDT (APFNDT); and for 10 out of the 20 GPS, their NCB for NDT has been accredited to ISO 17024.

Based on the criterion developed by RCA to assess the performance of GPs in terms of infrastructure, Australia, China, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea have excellent standards on this dimension. (See criterion and standards in Annex X)

## Inspection companies and training centers

Self reliance in NDT is a function of countries having the capacity to conduct inspection and train personnel with out depending on external stakeholders. An assessment to map whether GPs have inspection and training centers own locally or by foreigners was conducted to assess the level of self-reliance that each GP has. According to the criterion developed, a GP is considered to have an excellent standard (or to have achieved increased self-reliance) if their local inspection and training centres offer their services abroad. On the other hand, the self-reliance of a GP is considered inadequate if it does not have both training and certification centres owned by local or foreign firms.



As it can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:centre-standards) that displays the criterion and standards for this dimenssion. `r text_centres$excellent_num` countries (`r text_centres$excellent_text`) offer both training and inspection abroad.  `r text_centres$inadequate_text` do have access to inspection centres (either owned locally or by foreigners) but they do not have training centres offering services in their countries.
