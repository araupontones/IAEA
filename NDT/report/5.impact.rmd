This section aims to summarise the overall role of IAEA/RCA activities in achieving the general objectives and benefits of NDT on socio economic impact through industrial growth in each GP that is part of the programme.

Table \@ref(tab:impact-table) shows the perception of the GPs on the role that RCA has had to:

* Help speed up the adoption of NDT technologies since 2000.

* Contribute to the adoption of NDT technologies by private businesses since 2000.

* The proportion of total activity in the NDT sector in 2020 can be attributed to the programme.

* The productivity of NDT inspections (reduction of the average time to complete an inspection).



According to the own perception of the experts who participated in the online survey, **for `r text_impact$speed_y_perc` of the GPs, RCA NDT has helped to speed up the adoption of NDT technologies in their country since 2000**. For `r text_impact$cts_y1` the adoption occurred 1-3 years faster. Moreover, `r text_impact$cts_y2` perceive that NDT RCA contributed for the adoption of NDT technologies to happen 4-5 years faster; and **`r text_impact$cts_y2` think that the adoption occurred  6-10 years faster than with out the support of IAEA.**

The table also displays the perception on the role of IAEA/RCA activities in achieving the general objectives and benefits.
